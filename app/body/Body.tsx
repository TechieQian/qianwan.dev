        <b>Hello!</b> My name is Qian and I am a web developer. I began creating
        webpages during the geocities days and had the pleasure/pain of coding
        through the webdev eras. In college I majored in computer engineering
        and obsessed over FPGA and C++. But I eventually found my way back home
        in webdev. Now I change colors of buttons professionally. My comfort is
        ASP.NET and React/TypeScript.

          <b>Hello!</b> My name is Qian and I am a web developer. I began
          creating webpages during the geocities and angelfire days and had the
          pleasure/pain of coding through the webdev eras. In college I majored
          in computer engineering and obsessed over FPGA and C++. But I
          eventually found my way back home in webdev. Now I change colors of
          buttons professionally.

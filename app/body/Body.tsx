        <b>Hello!</b> My name is Qian and I am a software engineer with 10 years
        experience in fintech. I began creating webpages during the geocities
        days and had the pleasure/pain of coding through the webdev eras. In
        college I majored in computer engineering and obsessed over FPGA and
        C++. But I eventually found my way back home in webdev. My comfort is
        ASP.NET and React/TypeScript.
